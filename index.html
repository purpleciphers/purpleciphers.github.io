          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Hello and welcome! I build free, web-based simulators of historical cipher machines so people can use them without any coding or technical skills. This site is always in progress and although it's realatively small now the plan is to expand it to include many more ciphers. The name is inspired by my favorite color/cipher machine: PURPLE!</p>
